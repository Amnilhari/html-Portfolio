While my career is centered around technology, classical dance has been a constant passion in my life. It’s through this art form that I’ve learned discipline, creativity, and perseverance, qualities that complement my work as an engineer. As vice captain of my college dance team, I’ve had the opportunity to lead and inspire, balancing my technical pursuits with my love for dance.
